<div class="main"><h4>Who are you, and what do you do?</h4>
<p class="phil">My name is Philip Moore, I'm from Detroit, MI. I'm a Senior at Michigan State Univeristy majoring in Media and Information and minoring in Information Technology. I work at the MSU Computer Center Help Desk, mostly working in the hardware department, repairing computers. </p>
<p class="phil">I enjoy this job very much, because MSU pays me to do something that I love doing. Working at this job has given me the opportunity to work with many different brands of computers, learning the ins and outs of their hardware and software.</p>
<p class="phil">I'm a hard gamer, if I'm not fooling around with computers or doing some type of homework, you can catch me gaming online cracking heads. I recently switched over from my old faithful Xbox 360 to the Playstation 4. It's fucking amazing.! The graphics are the best feature about the PS4, it keeps my mind off the horrible lineup of games they have available right now.</p>

<h4>What hardware do you use?</h4>
<p class="phil">I'm currently using a 13" MacBook Pro. I switched over from PCs in 2011, since then I've come to realize that Apple computers are better than PCs. I realistically use my laptop for everything, making websites, doing homework assignments, everything. If I'm not playing the game I'm definitely using my MacBook Pro.</p>
<p class="phil">I have an android mobile device, because I do not want my experience personalized by Apple. I have an HTC One X. It's probably the best phone I've had since an LG flip phone. The processor speed, in HTC mobile devices, always keeps me upgrading.</p>

<h4>And what software?</h4>
<p class="phil">I recently upgrading my OS X to Mavericks. I was kind of reluctlant because everybody when Mavericks first came out, people would come into my job for OS reloads after the Mavericks download corrupted their OS. Scary Shit. To Know that you can't get back any of your data because Apple messed up the initial download file. Me being brave, I went ahead and downloaded Mavericks and install it with no problems at all. Lucky, huh?</p>
<p class="phil">Softwares that I have on my computer, ranges from Adobe Creative Suite to uTorrent.</p>
<p class="phil">I preferred to use Dreamweaver when making websites, but that was only because Dreamweaver would assist in some of the coding that I did not how to do. Codecademy is how I've taught myself how to use CSS, HTML,Phyton, C++, Javascript and jQuery. I've been using Codecademy for about 2-3 years now. I've since been using the text editor Atom to do my web design. It's alot easier than it seem when it was originally introduced to me when I took TC 331. Although web designing is something that I like doing very much, I feel that my true interest is in hardware repairs and software troubleshooting.</p></div>
